1. Square with size
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size
    Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
    You are not allowed to import any module

Why?

Why size is private attribute?

The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as class builder, must control the type and value of this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.

4. Access and update private attribute
mandatory
Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size:
        property def size(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
            size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
            if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
    Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
    Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
    You are not allowed to import any module

Why?

Why a getter and setter?

Reminder: size is a private attribute. We did that to make sure we control the type and value. Getter and setter methods are not 100% Python, but more OOP. With them, you will be able to validate the assignment of a private attribute and also define how getting the attribute value will be available from outside - by copy? by assignment? etc. Also, adding type/value validation in the setter will centralize the logic, since you will do it in only one place.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ cat 4-main.py

Square = __import__('4-square').Square

my_square = Square(89)
print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))

my_square.size = 3
print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))

try:
    my_square.size = "5 feet"
    print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
except Exception as e:
    print(e)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x06$ ./4-main.py
