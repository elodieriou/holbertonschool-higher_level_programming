```

## 6. Find a peak

Technical interview preparation:

    You are not allowed to google anything
    Whiteboard first

Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

    Prototype: def find_peak(list_of_integers):
    You are not allowed to import any module
    Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need to go through all numbers to find a peak)
    6-peak.py must contain the function
    6-peak.txt must contain the complexity of your algorithm: O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)
    Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
```commandline
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ cat 6-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Test function find_peak """
find_peak = __import__('6-peak').find_peak

print(find_peak([1, 2, 4, 6, 3]))
print(find_peak([4, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1]))
print(find_peak([2, 2, 2]))
print(find_peak([]))
print(find_peak([-2, -4, 2, 1]))
print(find_peak([4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1]))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ ./6-main.py
6
3
2
None
2
4
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ wc -l 6-peak.txt 
2 6-peak.txt
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ 
```

# Task advanced
## 7. Only status code

Write a Bash script that sends a request to a URL passed as an argument, and displays only the status code of the response.

    You are not allowed to use any pipe, redirection, etc.
    You are not allowed to use ; and &&
    You have to use curl

Please test your script in the sandbox provided, using the web server running on port 5000
```commandline
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ ./100-status_code.sh 0.0.0.0:5000 ; echo ""
200
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ ./100-status_code.sh 0.0.0.0:5000/nop ; echo ""
404
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ 
```

## 8. cURL a JSON file

Write a Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL passed as the first argument, and displays the body of the response.

    Your script must send a POST request with the contents of a file, passed with the filename as the second argument of the script, in the body of the request
    You have to use curl

Please test your scripts in the sandbox provided, using the web server running on port 5000
```commandline
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ cat my_json_0
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 33
}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ ./101-post_json.sh 0.0.0.0:5000/route_json my_json_0 ; echo ""
Valid JSON
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ cat my_json_1
I'm a JSON! really!
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ ./101-post_json.sh 0.0.0.0:5000/route_json my_json_1 ; echo ""
Not a valid JSON
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ cat my_json_2
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 33,
}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ ./101-post_json.sh 0.0.0.0:5000/route_json my_json_2 ; echo ""
Not a valid JSON
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x10$ 
```

## 9. Catch me if you can!

Write a Bash script that makes a request to 0.0.0.0:5000/catch_me that causes the server to respond with a message containing You got me!, in the body of the response.
